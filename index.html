                <p>The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is
                    something that runs deep within everyone, even though most
                    people don't take the time to find someone who truly
                    respects them. It seems like people are just looking for
                    someone to show them the slightest amount of attention,
                    settling for something much less than respect. I am
                    convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow
                    is by showing respect.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be                              
                    respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra
                    special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show
                    them how highly they are valued.</p>
